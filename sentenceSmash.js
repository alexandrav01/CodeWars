// Sentence Smash

// Write a function that takes an array of words and 
//smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. 
//You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, 
//but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, 
//there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

// Example
// ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

//1 add variable sentence
//2 add strings and add spaces between
//3 return result

function smash (words) {
    return ""
 };
